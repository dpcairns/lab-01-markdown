**I want bold text with two asterices**

*I want italics text with one asterix*

__I want bold text with two asterices__

_I want italics text with one asterix_

* Here is a list
* It has several items
    * Nested lists work with dashes or asterix

- I can use dashes instead if I want
- And it works fine
    - If I hit tab and make a bullet, I get a nested list

1. Here is a numbered list
1. I'm using the number one again
1. Here is the number one once more
    1. I can do nested numbers
    1. Like so
1. Okay.
